<p>In this project, I practiced the traditional RESTful APIs to clearly organize the application structure. In the web front end developing aspect, I was able to add images, buttons, navigation bars, and configured consistent aesthetic design. (I put heart and soul into the aesthetic design but from my user tests result, apparently the feedback is mixed.) I am able to separate the header and footer from other static and non-static components of the website. Additionally, I was able to implement user models. The website is now functional as the user can sign up, log in. In the sign up process, the website can check inputs validity. For example, REGEX was applied here to check email address the user typed in. Also, to authenticate the user trying to log in, the website can check the database for usersâ€™ input. I also used cookie to store the user information so that one can be automatically logged in before the cookie is lost. The part I am most proud of is the selective display of contents and check of authority access. As shown in the code snippet in question 1, I was able to check if the user is logged in before allowing the users to see some of the contents such as user index, and to change the user profiles. I also wrote extensive tests to cover most of the major features of my projects, and I believe this is quite an essential part in software development. </p>

The Alternate Language Study Option (ALSO) program is a self-instructional/peer-tutored language learning program designed for highly self-motivated and disciplined students who want to learn a language not taught through the regular curriculum at Grinnell. The program provides a two-semester sequence of beginning level study in several languages, including but not limited to Italian, Portuguese, Korean, Hindi, and Kiswahili. The specific languages offered depend on the number of students interested and the availability of trained peer tutors.
